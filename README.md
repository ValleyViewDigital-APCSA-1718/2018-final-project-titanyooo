Greenfoot game
## Assignment:

AP Computer Science Project I
(Modified from Mr. Lew’s Fall Project)
This project will require you to design and implement a Java-based game or simulation. It will be completed in 4 phases. Each phase is described below:

Phase I - Proposal
Page 1:
Title of your project goes here (e.g. “Othello”)

Project Summary – This section should be a description of your project. It should address things such as the operation of the game/simulation, rules, number of players, artificial intelligence, special features you want to implement, etc. Summaries that go into a good amount of detail are usually ½ to ¾ pages in length.

Page 2:
Screenshot(s) – Here you will sketch screenshot(s) for different views of your project. You may hand draw or electronically draw your screenshot, but it must be self-drawn. Please do not include downloaded picts or jpgs. Include multiple diagrams if your project will present the user with different screens. Include a brief description of each screenshot.

IMPORTANT: View this proposal as a way to REALLY plan out your project (not as another
HW assignment). The more thorough you are in the planning stages, the fewer roadblocks,
programming issues, and bugs you will face when you actually begin coding. Starting to code from the ground up without a good plan in place is quintessential cowboy programming. And that is not a good thing, in the Wild West or anywhere else.

 
Phase II – Java Program
The program must include the following items.
	1.	At least two relational (==, !=, >, >=, <, <=) and two logical operators ( &&, ||, !)
	2.	At least two “if-then-else” statements.
	3.	At least two of the following: for loop, for-each loop, and while loop.
	4.	At least ONE student-designed interface and THREE student-designed classes (one of which MUST be abstract), not including your driver class (e.g. “OthelloDriver.java”) – which brings the total to FIVE.
	5.	At least one instance of Class Composition (“has-a” relationship) must be used in your project. Recall that “Class Composition” is using another class as an “instance variable” for your class. 
	6.	Interaction between all your student-designed classes/interfaces in your project must be implemented. Specifically, each class must call method(s) from another class in your project.
	7.	An Inheritance hierarchy (“is-a” relationship) must be implemented with the student-designed 
	8.	At least one student-designed interface must be implemented in the project.
	9.	Polymorphism must be implemented with the student-designed classes.
	10.	Class ArrayList or a 2D Array must be used in at least ONE student-designed class and it MUST be traversed through AND accessed via a for loop OR a for-each loop.
	11.	Your project must demonstrate a high level of “algorithmic complexity.” That is, your “brain” or “processing” methods should show a high degree of problem solving ability.
	12.	Comments explaining logic and operation of program at “key points” (e.g. special algorithm to determine possible next moves in Chess, to check winners in Connect Four, to follow Pac-Man around the screen, etc.)
	13.	Meaningful and variable/class names throughout (class, methods, variable name, instance variables, etc.)
	14.	Including comments for each of your methods in at least student-designed class. 
     15.	Use of JOptionPane for user input.

See the website for ideas on projects. Projects whose code has been released are not eligible project ideas unless SIGNIFICANT changes are proposed that will make it UNIQUE from the original.

The Final Project is due on your assigned lottery date. THERE WILL BE A 15% deduction of points for each day that the project is late. There will be a 5 point deduction for each typographical or grammatical error.




 
Phase III – Project Submission Guidelines
By 8am on the morning of your presentation, you should submit your entire file on GitHub’

In addition, create a Notes file that should include a “Description”, “How to play”, and “Interesting Features” text that will be used to describe your project when it is posted to the website. See the example below.

Example:
Description:
My game is simple single player pong game with an AI controlled opponent and a scoreboard. It is similar to the original pong except for a few key features. The objective of the game is to get as many points as possible by getting the ball past the opposing player. The game ends when the total score has reached 9. The AI difficulty can be changed in order to change the difficulty level. The game starts with a simple window asking whether or not you would like to play; after that there is an eight second timer then the game begins.

How to play:
Click the "DOWN" button in order to get the paddle to move down, and click the "UP" button in order to get the ball to move up.

Interesting Features:
1. The AI's difficulty setting and the AI's algorithm are both set by only two numbers. The difficulty setting is a number between 60 - 99 and the higher the number the harder it is to defeat the AI. The second number is a random number between 1 - 100, should the difficulty setting be higher than this number than the AI is allowed to move towards the paddle, but if the random number be higher than the difficulty setting, the paddle remains in place.
2. Constant motion of the paddle is another key feature of my game. The paddle is designed to be in almost constant motion in order to add another level of difficulty to the game. The paddle only stops at the bottom and top of the screen. This prevents the paddle from leaving the game entirely.


 
Phase IV – Presentation (This is tentative as of 5/16/18)
A Powerpoint/Keynote presentation should be given on your lottery date. The presentation shall have, at minimum, the following slides:
a.	Title
b.	Description of program operation (or how game is played)
c.	Demonstration of Program (Task switch from your slide show presentation to your program using Alt-Tab or Cmd-Tab)
d.	UML Diagrams for each class
e.	Use of classes/objects in project - elaborate on how classes represent physical objects in your program (be prepared to justify class names, class data member names, class method names…)
f.	Description of class interaction (be prepared to discuss how each class interacts with the other classes)
g.	Description of use of an inheritance hierarchy (be prepared to justify structure)
h.	Description of use of an interface (be prepared to justify its use with other classes)
i.	Description of use of polymorphism (include a code snippet that demonstrates polymorphism)
j.	Special features implemented in program - elaborate on tricks/special things you did
k.	Known bugs in program
l.	Citation of “second-party” code used in program (be able to explain code; not including GridWorld GUI)
m.	Conclusion - Summary of what you thought of writing the program 
	i.	Difficulty level, 
	ii. 	"Fun" level, 
	iii. 	Your evaluation of the final product, 
iv.	What you learned (be specific)
n.	Questions? (this is simply a slide that says “Questions?” that keys the audience for any questions they might have)


Pointers for your final project:
1.	START EARLY!! Don’t wait until after Christmas to begin your project!! 
2.	Test your program on the presentation computer before the presentation date.
3.	Using System.out.println() statements to display values during the debugging process.
4.	MAKE BACKUPS OF YOUR WORK!!
5.	And, of course,…HAVE FUN :-) !!
